Провести жизнь в наших тюрьмах — это гораздо хуже смертной казни».\nО стирке:\nОднажды в обед я сидел со своим подносом за фанерным пинг-понговым столом. Рядом со мной уселся мексиканец Эфраим, придвинув красный пластиковый стул. Несколько минут мы сосредоточенно ели.\n— Buena comida? (Вкусно?) — спросил я его по-испански.\nЭфраим улыбнулся, но ответить не успел. Сзади на его плечо легла ладонь огромного негра.\n— Ты снимал мои вещи со стула? — в голосе его дрожало бешенство. Эфраим не понял, он не говорил по-английски. Сидевший напротив пуэрториканец бросился переводить сбивчивым шепотом. Очевидно, Эфраим без спроса черного владельца переложил на подоконник сушащиеся после стирки кальсоны. Не дав пуэрториканцу договорить, негр заорал:\n— Переведи этому… пусть просит прощения! Эфраим, с побелевшими желваками на натянувшемся лице, выслушал перевод и что-то глухо сказал по-испански. Пуэрториканец замялся, но потом все же перевел: — Он говорит, что прощения просить не будет. Конец этой фразы совпал с ударом. Эфраим вместе со стулом был сбит на пол. Но никто не шевельнулся, ни один человек, даже латиноамериканцы, только сразу повисла напряженная тишина. По лицу мексиканца, заливая глаза, текла кровь, а нога негра уже давила ему горло.\nТюремные юристы:\nСовершенно другой тип — арестантский юрист (или, по меткому определению одного русского зека, «лойерок»). Чаще всего это долгосрочник, иногда многократно судимый, набивший руку на составлении апелляций, жалоб и прошений, знающий на личном опыте самые разные аспекты уголовного законодательства Некоторые «лойерки» имеют много мелких клиентов: один хочет перевестись в тюрьму поближе к дому, другой оспаривает дисциплинарное взыскание, третий добивается диетической пищи. «Лой-ерок» готов помочь любому за пару блоков сигарет. Есть и юристы, которые берутся только за крупные дела; составление апелляции или подготовку к иммиграционному слушанию. В таких случаях счет идет на сотни долларов. Их с великими предосторожностями на воле передает доверенному лицу «лойерка» семья клиента.\nМне неоднократно приходилось слышать, что некоторые арестантские юристы работают качественнее, чем профессионалы. На воле действительно трудно найти адвоката нужного профиля. Многолетний опыт личного общения с судебными и тюремными инстанциями зачастую формирует у «лойерков» некое шестое чувство, которого лишены корифеи права с Бродвея и Мэдисон-авеню.\nТюремные бухгалтера:\nВ советских лагерях некоторые заключенные с художественными способностями могли выжить благодаря покровительству администрации. Солженицын писал о художнике, снятом с общих работ, чтобы рисовать пейзажи и натюрморты для «кума». У Шаламова упоминался музыкант, обучавший пению жену начальника лагеря. В американских тюрьмах их таланты вряд ли бы нашли себе применение: здешние власти не претендуют на любовь к искусству. Зато услуги виртуоза-бухгалтера в Уотертаунской тюрьме пришлись весьма кстати. Все местное начальство ходило к нему со своими декларациями о доходах. Манипулируя чрезвычайно запутанными налоговыми законами США, бухгалтер экономил для тюремщиков сотни и тысячи долларов. В его распоряжение предоставили персональный компьютер, а в качестве вознаграждения выделили лучшее место в почетном бараке, где он мог пользоваться грилем и холодильником.\nПро веру:\n— А ты в Бога веришь? — спросил меня как-то Семен Драбин, сосед по этапному корпусу острова Райкерс.\n— Верю, конечно, — сказал я, — правда, в детстве были у меня проблемы с конфессией: отец православный, мать еврейка, и справляли мы всегда обе Пасхи.\n— Интересно… — Драбин отхлебнул из пластиковой чашки кофе и поморщился. — А я, бля, буддист, вот. Мой отчим покойный все про это знал: переселение душ и все такое. Ох, хороший был человек, с понятиями. Он мне так объяснял: вот умирает человек, и приходит его душа к Богу. И другие души перед Богом стоят. А Бог им говорит: «Ну что, ребята, хотите обратно на землю?» Все кричат, что, мол, конечно, давай нам еще одну жизнь. А Бог головой качает и говорит: «Ладно, что с вами поделать, летите, ничего-то вы не поняли». А я, отчим мой объяснял, я уже понял. Скажу, говорит, не хочу больше на землю, хочу с папочкой быть — с Богом то есть… Устал, говорит, жить уже, вот. И ведь как в воду глядел — месяца не прошло, и скончался. На Брайтоне в карты играл, кто-то вошел и две пули прямо в голову всадил. За что, не знаю — человек два срока в Союзе отмотал, никто пальцем не тронул, а тут…\nМы помолчали.\nЦелибат:\nЗа попытку полового контакта на свидании тюремные власти карают не менее строго, чем за пронос алкоголя или наркотиков.\nЖивой груз:\n«Сменщики» оказались американо-мексиканскими бандитами самой мрачной наружности. Абдунасера без лишних объяснений положили в багажник старого «понтиака» и втиснули сверху еще двух малорослых перуанских индейцев. Египтянина, двоих эквадорцев и одного колумбийца проводники разместили на заднем сиденье, сами уселись спереди — и тяжело нагруженная машина покатила кружным путем в «город ангелов», быстро нагреваясь на июльской жаре. Примерно через полтора часа до слуха контрабандистов донесся глухой стук из багажника и сдавленные крики: «Uno muerto! Onе dead!» Некоторое время они не реагировали, но в конце концов все-таки остановили машину и вынули из-под индейцев бледно-зеленого Абдунасера, который действительно чуть не умер от духоты. Абдунасер думал, что его через пару минут засунут обратно, но мексиканцы, сжалившись, дали ему место в салоне. В багажник отправили одного из эквадорцев, который перенес это совершенно стоически.\nХасиды:\nНаиболее известным прецедентом в деле раввина Хэлбранса было похищение в 1959 году сына иммигрантов из России Иосифа Шумахера, произошедшее в Израиле и едва не приведшее к гражданской войне в этом государстве. Дед Шумахера по материнской линии Нахман Штаркес, бреславский хасид и бывший узник сталинских лагерей, отказался вернуть внука нерелигиозным родителям и организовал его вывоз из страны по поддельному паспорту. После ареста Штаркеса израильской полицией верховный раввин Иерусалима призвал верующих к кампании гражданского неповиновения, а поиски Иосифа Шумахера были поручены премьер-министром Израиля Бен-Гурионом разведслужбе Моссад. Операция «Тигр», задействовавшая едва ли не всю иностранную агентуру Моссада, сравнивалась по своим масштабам с охотой за нацистским преступником Адольфом Эйхманом.\nЛишь в июле 1962 года Иосиф Шумахер был обнаружен разведслужбой в Нью-Йорке и с помощью ФБР возвращен в Израиль. Методы конспирации, с помощью которых хасиды прятали Шумахера в Европе и США, были настолько профессиональны, что одному из участников похищения впоследствии было предложено стать агентом Моссада. Предложение это было отвергнуто.\nраввин Хэлбранс:\nВпоследствии, уже окончив иешиву и приобретя определенную известность в религиозных кругах, раввин Хэлбранс испытал остракизм израильского общества уже по чисто политическим причинам. Сатмарские хасиды примыкают в Израиле к движению «Нетуре карта», которое отказывает в легитимности современному еврейскому государству как таковому. Идеологи этого движения, ссылаясь на Тору и мнения некоторых известных раввинов, считают, что лишь с приходом Мессии еврейскому народу дано будет воссоздать теократическое царство и восстановить Иерусалимский Храм. Немногим за пределами Израиля известно, что «Нетуре карта» неоднократно обращалось в ООН с антисиони-стскими декларациями и выступало с поддержкой Организации освобождения Палестины. Один из идейных предшественников движения, религиозный еврей Яков Де Хаан, был в 1922 году застрелен сионистскими боевиками. Раввин Хэлбранс, опубликовавший книгу с осуждением сионизма, был, по его словам, неоднократно побиваем камнями в самом прямом смысле.\nВ тюрьме «Фишкилл» я был свидетелем горячих споров между Хэлбрансом и заключенным израильтянином, обвинявшим его в отсутствии патриотизма. Одним из ответных аргументов раввина было то, что в израильском государстве с момента его создания в 1948 году погибло больше евреев, чем в коммунистической России или баасистской Сирии за то же время.\nКолумбийцы:\nМногие заключенные-колумбийцы словно воплощают в микрокосме эту противоречивую природу своей страны. Они, как правило, имеют приличное образование, значительно превосходя в этом отношении среднего южного, а тем более северного американца. Говорят они, почти не употребляя жаргона, на очень литературном испанском языке. Другие латиноамериканцы в тюрьме охотно признают: «В Колумбии говорят правильнее всего». Колумбийцы очень интересуются политикой — как международной, так и внутренней. Они могут часами обсуждать достоинства и недостатки консерваторов («синих»), либералов («красных»), а также различных крайне левых и крайне правых группировок, которые в Колумбии напоминают частные армии. Колумбийцы в тюрьме ведут себя очень сдержанно, почти никогда не кричат. Многие из них даже старомодно вежливы, крестятся перед едой, чтут святых и Матерь Божью.\nНо если удается вызвать заключенного-колумбийца на доверительный разговор, то можно услышать вещи весьма мрачные. Например, рассказы об уничтожении их картелями всех родственников доносчика или нечестного партнера, включая стариков и детей. Оптовую торговлю наркотиками многие колумбийцы считают благом для всей их нации.\nЭпизод:\nЯ отнес свои пожитки в новую камеру и пошел назад за матрасом. И тут меня осенила мысль: «Китаец, прежде чем сказать мне, наверняка проверил бы, что именно лежит в пакете. Значит, там действительно были наркотики — наверное, специально на глазах у китайца засыпанные. Если бы он мне не сказал, я бы так и ушел в другую камеру с пакетом в кармане и не знал бы потом, как он там оказался. А если бы мне устроили обыск… Что ж, это был бы прекрасный способ от меня избавиться. Ведь колумбиец предполагал, что стукач — я… Так и в России по понятиям считается: замусорить мусора — не западло. Не зазорно…\nВот почему он подходил к окну! В тот момент, когда он повернулся ко мне спиной, пакет был подменен. Наверное, колумбиец и в столовую не ходил, а стоял за дверью и подсматривал — чтобы войти, пока я не успел открыть пакет. Ведь он понимал, что за наркотики я стал бы ему мстить, а за эту комедию с опилками… так, обижусь, что не поставил в известность… бестактность проявил… Ах, чтобы дьявол…»\n— Чего задумался? — знакомый голос вывел меня из оцепенения. Передо мной стоял колумбиец с моим матрасом под мышкой. — Решил вот тебе помочь. Хотя ты зря уходишь. Сейчас мог бы и остаться. Компьютер тебя проверил, — и он, загоготав, похлопал себя по лбу.\n— Знаешь что, — сказал я колумбийцу, — послушай один совет на прощание. Ты, вижу, себя очень умным считаешь. Мастер играть людьми. И страха не имеешь. Я таких, как ты, встречал и в моей стране, и здесь.\nТакие люди долго не живут. Попомни мои слова. В изжелта-карих глазах колумбийца сверкнули злые искры. Он молча поставил матрас к стене, повернулся и ушел прочь.. Вечером того же дня китаец попросил администрацию о переводе в блок «добровольной изоляции». В одиночных камерах этого блока держали заключенных, которым по разным причинам грозила опасность.\nЗаключение.\r#\rЗахватывающее чтиво.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/docs/main-section/books/culture/chelovek-sidyaschiy/","title":"Chelovek Sidyaschiy","section":"Culture","content":"\rЧеловек сидящий\r#\rDisclaimer\r#\rО книге.\r#\r\u0026ldquo;Автор рассказывает о годах, проведенных в качестве заключенного сначала в СИЗО, а потом в Тагильской исправительной колонии для бывших сотрудников правоохранительных органов. Автор погружает читателя в мир бесправия, где заключенные стремятся выжить, а стража – выжать из них как можно больше. Книга состоит из документальных очерков, написанных на основе авторских воспоминаний.\nИх герои – «сидельцы» с разными судьбами, характерами, с разной способностью уцелеть физически и нравственно в условиях тотальной несвободы, постоянного унижения, голода, рабского труда и разлуки с родными. Все имена и фамилии изменены.\u0026rdquo; (из описания на litres.ru)\nИнтересный моменты из книги.\r#\rНадежда его на амнистию была безапелляционна. К апрелю вокруг стали кружить неофиты,включая старых сидельцев с тяжкими и особо тяжкими статьями. Идея превратилась в веру и заражала массы. Кружок разрастался и стал обществом. Народ в лагере меткий на определения, и общество незамедлительно получило название «Ж.О. П. А.» — Желающие Освободиться По Амнистии. Источники информации тщательно фильтровались. Негодные отсеивались. Ценились Администрация президента, Госдума и Генпрокуратура.\n— Вчера на отряд пацанчик заехал, говорит, у него брат водителем в Госдуме у депутата, — сеял туман Серебро перед вечерней перекличкой. — Так тот говорит, сто процентов уже законопроект подали.\n— Говорят, во ФСИН уже прислали указание, кого первым освобождать, а то, прикинь, указ вышел, а нас тут пятьсот человек в один день выпускать надо, — убеждал он за завтраком апологетов.\n«Ж. О. П. А.» овладела массами. Критиков уничтожали взглядами и меткими репликами, критики стали опасаться и примолкли. Высказывания пересидков из Госдумы, где они рассуждают о необходимости амнистии, уполномоченного по правам человека зэки начали заучивать наизусть и пересказывать. Они были очень убедительны тогда — и Жириновский, и Зюганов, и даже Миронов. Страшно популярным стал Крашенинников (ну это чувак вообще уважаемый из Госдумы) — цитаты из него разлетались и уничтожали сомневающихся.\nЗакончилось все одномоментно. Вечерние новости и очередная фейковая амнистия сразили. «Ж. О. П. А.» распалась.\nReferences.\r#\rlitres.ru\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/docs/main-section/books/culture/no_human_contact/","title":"No Human Contact","section":"Culture","content":"\rNo Human Contact\r#\rDisclaimer\r#\rAbout.\r#\rAnother great read about life of two (former) Aryan Brotherhood (prison gang) members Thomas Silverstein and Clayton Fountain both given multiple life sentences in U.S. penitentiary system.\nInteresting moments from book (spoiler alert).\r#\rSilverstein soon was mouthing the same mantra that he heard from AB gang members, such as Dallas Scott. Most whites don’t stand up for each other, he wrote later. If black guys jump a white guy, the other whites will turn to the side and think, “Boy I’m glad it’s not me.” It’s sickening. They don’t realize that a day or two later, they are going to get beaten up. It’s not that I’m on any kind of racist trip or anything. It’s just how it is in prison. If you’re white, you either bend over and get fucked or you align yourself with stand-up guys willing to fight.\nBeef with Raymond Lee “Cadillac” Smith:\nI’M KILLING YOUR ASS, SILVERSTEIN.” It was the morning of May 11, 1982, and Silverstein had been looking at a nude photo of a former girlfriend when he’d realized someone was threatening him outside his cell bars in the Control Unit. He looked up, but didn’t recognize the Black inmate speaking to him. “You hear me, cracker? I’m killing your punk ass,” Raymond Lee “Cadillac” Smith continued.\n“I don’t even know you. I don’t want any trouble,” Silverstein replied. “You killed two of my homies, you punk-ass cracker.” Silverstein was confused.\n\u0026hellip;Silverstein flew by Fountain and tackled Cadillac, knocking him off his feet. The Black man’s head smacked hard against the concrete, stunning him. “I grabbed the shank he was holding, with my bare right hand, as he struggled to stand,” Silverstein said. “He tried to rip it from my fingers, but I held on and managed to pull the blade away from him. I slammed it into his chest before pulling it out and then jabbing it again and again and again as quickly as I could. He tried to block each thrust with his right arm while trying to punch me in the face with his left fist. One of his blows hit my jaw, causing me to back up and gulp for air before I lunged back at him. I heard him scream, ‘What did I do?’ and I thought, ‘You fuckin’ serious? Suddenly he’s the victim?’”\nFountain\u0026rsquo;s literacy:\nDavis (~ Ron Davis, energetic twenty-nine-year-old reporter, Springfield News-Leader newspaper) began drafting preinterview questions to mail Fountain, in case the BOP turned down his face-to-face request. He typed up seventy-six pages of queries, leaving space on each page for answers. Days later, a thick parcel arrived. Davis rushed into Ziegler’s office with it. Fountain had written such detailed answers that he’d run out of space on each page and had attached twenty-five extra ones. Davis and Ziegler marveled at Fountain’s impeccable penmanship and noted that the convict had not erased or scratched through any of his handwritten answers. At the end of several sentences, he’d added a smiley face or some other image. “He was using emoticons before most of us knew what they were,” Davis recalled. There was not one misspelling in the thousands of words he’d written.\nTHOMAS SILVERSTEIN on doing life:\nMost of us lifers are down for so long and have so much time to kill that we actually fool around and discover our niche in life, often in ways we never even dreamt possible on the streets.\nTHOMAS SILVERSTEIN on no human contact:\nKollerer knew about Silverstein from reading The Hot House and she asked him to write a two-page article about his no-human-contact status. She printed his reply with one of his drawings. A physical beating causes pain but ends, he wrote. Total solitary is more of a slow constant peeling of the skin, stripping of the flesh, the nerve-wracking sound of water dripping from a leaky faucet in the still of the night while you’re trying to sleep. Drip, drip, drip, the minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years constantly drip away with no end or relief in sight . . . You hear yourself screaming . . . wanting to badly, with all your heart and soul, to leap from your seat, not only to stop ’em but slap the holy shit out of ‘em for driving you this insane, where it’s caused you to resort to violence after you could not bear it anymore . . .\nTorture:\nThe woman had been four-pointed, with each of her limbs chained to a hook for twenty-three days. Prison officials said it was for her own good because she was suicidal. “There was no psychiatric treatment, so they’d simply chained her down and only freed one of her hands three times a day to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,” Strick remembered. Strick wrote an article for the Xpress. She began contacting local women’s groups and got their members to write protest letters to the Florida governor. Her campaign forced the bureau to transfer the woman to a medical center. “The public had no idea what was happening in these prisons,” Strick said later. “They didn’t want to know.”\nRamzi Ahmed Yousef:\nYousef drove a truck filled with explosives into the North Tower’s underground parking garage on February 26, 1993. He thought the blast would send the tower crashing into the South Tower, killing as many as 250,000 people. It didn’t, but 6 people were killed and 1,042 were injured, including 88 firefighters and 35 police officers.\nFirst conversation in 22 years:\n“Who’s there?” a prisoner in the cell next to him hollered.\n“Who are you?” Silverstein shouted back. He’d not had a conversation with another inmate in more than twenty years.\n“Ramzi Ahmed Yousef.”\nAfter twenty-two years of not being able to speak to another inmate, I was excited to have the opportunity to talk to anyone, Silverstein wrote. We had to shout to each other and it was difficult to hear, but it was still nice to be able to hear your own voice in conversation, and a friendly voice replying.\nDavid Shelby:\nAnother ADX prisoner, David Shelby, had schizophrenia and had become convinced in 1995 that God wanted him to free Charles Manson by sending threatening letters to President Bill Clinton. He arrived at the ADX in 2000, and after spending nine years in solitary confinement, he tried to commit suicide by slashing his arms, legs, and stomach. He’d cut off the top of his left pinkie finger and eaten it mixed into a bowl of ramen. “After he ate his finger, they were taking him out of his cell and one of the officers asked him what his finger tasted like,” Aro said. “That perfectly illustrates how fucking insensitive these people were at the ADX. It was a level of inhumanity that was unfathomable to me.”\nADX’s D Unit cellhouse:\nOn April 3, 2008—after spending thirty-four months isolated on Range 13—Silverstein was transferred into the ADX’s D Unit cellhouse. At first, he was the only prisoner on a floor, but he eventually was moved to a regular tier with other prisoners. “A prison orderly was supposed to clean empty cells between occupants, but clearly hadn’t bothered. As soon as they locked me in, I assessed the sweat I’d need to scrub my new cell. We were not allowed to have detergent, nor much needed disinfectant, only water from the sink and a towel. I inspected the toilet/sink combination first, since it’s usually the nastiest in need of cleaning. Then the shower, where some guys masturbate, blow their nose, spit, piss, but rarely clean, so the stainless steel is covered in months and years of fossilized slime. The toilet bowl was covered with some stranger’s feces that I would have to remove with bare hands, without soap to wash afterward to kill the germs and stink off of them. The shit was literally caked on and petrified. It not only reeked, the sight made me want to vomit while wondering how many dirty, diseased prisoners with AIDs, Hep C, had sat here before me. The former occupant had thrown dried turds through the bars onto the cell’s outer steel door. I couldn’t reach the steel door to clean it off, so the stink lingered.”\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/docs/main-section/books/math/","title":"Math","section":"Books","content":"\rAutobiographies\r#\rArchitecture of Mathematics By Simon Serovajsky Can\u0026rsquo;t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds, David Goggins One odd logical operator "},{"id":18,"href":"/docs/main-section/books/philosophy/","title":"Philosophy","section":"Books","content":"\rfilosofi\r#\rOne-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society, Herbert Marcuse The Society of the Spectacle, Guy Debord Concept of mind "},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/main-section/books/politics/","title":"Politics","section":"Books","content":"\rPhilosophy\r#\r"},{"id":20,"href":"/docs/main-section/books/software-development/","title":"Software Development","section":"Books","content":"\r3rd Level of Menu\r#\rSpring in Action, Fourth Edition: Covers Spring 4 (summary) Another book Cypress limitations 2023 "},{"id":21,"href":"/docs/main-section/books/software-development/cypress_limitations_2023/","title":"Cypress Limitations 2023","section":"Software Development","content":"Cypress limitations 2023.

Springing into action. This chapter covers. •  Spring’s bean container •  Exploring Spring’s core modules •  The greater Spring ecosystem •  What’s new in Spring\n1.1 Simplifying Java development Spring simplifies Java development:\n•  Lightweight and minimally invasive development with POJOs\r•  Loose coupling through DI and interface orientation\r•  Declarative programming through aspects and common conventions\r•  Eliminating boilerplate code with aspects and templates\r1.1.2 Injecting dependencies HOW DI WORKS. Listing 1.2 Consider Knight class:\nA DamselRescuingKnight can only embark on RescueDamselQuests.\npackage com.springinaction.knights;\npublic class DamselRescuingKnight implements Knight { private RescueDamselQuest quest;\npublic DamselRescuingKnight() { this.quest = new RescueDamselQuest(); }\npublic void embarkOnQuest() { quest.embark();}}\nThis makes a DamselRescuingKnight tightly coupled to a Rescue – DamselQuest. No unit testing can be accomplished: can’t assert that the quest’s embark() method is called when the knight’s embarkOnQuest() method is called. Tightly coupled code exhibits “whack-a-mole” bug behavior (fixing one bug results new bugs). On the other hand, …, classes need to know about each other somehow.\nCoupling is necessary but should be carefully managed. With DI, objects are given their dependencies at creation time by some third party that coordinates each object in the system. Listing 1.3 A BraveKnight is flexible enough to take on any Quest he’s given. (Note: BraveKnight, unlike DamselRescuingKnight, doesn’t create his own quest. Instead, he’s given a quest at construction time as a constructor argument).\npackage com.springinaction.knights;\npublic class BraveKnight implements Knight { private Quest quest;\npublic BraveKnight(Quest quest) { this.quest = quest; } public void embarkOnQuest() { quest.embark();}}\nQuest is injected (~ construction injection). Quest in a an interface, so BK can embark on any other Quest implementation he’s given. Also to test BraveKnight you can inject it with a mock Quest.\rINJECTING A QUEST INTO A KNIGHT Listing 1.5 SlayDragonQuest is a Quest to be injected into BraveKnight.\npackage com.springinaction.knights; import java.io.PrintStream; public class SlayDragonQuest implements Quest { private PrintStream stream;\npublic SlayDragonQuest(PrintStream stream) { this.stream = stream; } // notice that rather than lean on System.out .println() like many small getting-started Java samples, SlayDragonQuest more generically asks for a PrintStream through its constructor.// end of comment.\npublic void embark() { stream.println(\u0026ldquo;Embarking on quest to slay the dragon!\u0026rdquo;);}}\nHow can we give SlayDragonQuest to BraveKnight? And PrintStream to SlayDragonQuest? The act of creating associations between application components is commonly referred to as wiring.\nListing 1.6 XML based configuration (wiring). Injecting a SlayDragonQuest into a BraveKnight:\nNote: SlayDragonQuest bean declaration uses the Spring Expression Language to pass System.out.\nListing 1.7 Java-based configuration (alternative to XML shown in listing 1.6).\npackage com.springinaction.knights.config; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import com.springinaction.knights.BraveKnight; import com.springinaction.knights.Knight; import com.springinaction.knights.Quest; import com.springinaction.knights.SlayDragonQuest;\n@Configuration public class KnightConfig {\n@Bean public Knight knight() { return new BraveKnight(quest()); }\n@Bean public Quest quest() { return new SlayDragonQuest(System.out);}}\nBenefits of DI : Dependent classes (BK and SDQ) do not know how their dependencies come to be. Spring manages them through configuration. This makes possible to change those dependencies.\nSEEING IT WORK Application context loads bean definitions and wires them together.\nListing 1.8 main() creates the Spring application context based on the knights.xml file:\npackage com.springinaction.knights; import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;\npublic class KnightMain { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\u0026ldquo;META-INF/spring/knight.xml\u0026rdquo;); // Loading context\nKnight knight = context.getBean(Knight.class); // Get the knight bean knight.embarkOnQuest(); // Use it context.close();}}\nNote: knights.xml file knows what the implementations are (BraveKnight and SlayDragonQuest as shown in 1.6).\n1.1.3 Applying aspects.\nAspect-oriented programming (AOP) enables you to capture functionality that’s used throughout your application in reusable components. In more detail: Components in system tend to carry responsibilities beyond their core functionality. Logging is prime example. By spreading these concerns across multiple components: • The code that implements the system-wide concerns is duplicated across multiple components. • Your components are littered with code that isn’t alligned with their core functionality. In short, aspects ensure that POJO’s remain plain. AOP modularizes services: this results components are more cohesive (focus on their own specific concerns), completely ignorant of any system services (logging, transaction management, security \u0026amp; so on). Illustrated (without AOP):\nIllustrated with AOP:\nListing 1.9 Simplified – Minstrel class that serves as logger to previously shown Knight.class.\npackage com.springinaction.knights; import java.io.PrintStream;\npublic class Minstrel { private PrintStream stream;\npublic Minstrel(PrintStream stream) { this.stream = stream; }\npublic void singBeforeQuest() { stream.println(\u0026ldquo;Quest started!\u0026rdquo;); } public void singAfterQuest() { stream.println(\u0026ldquo;Quest finished!\u0026rdquo;);}}\nNote: Listing 1.10 illustrates the wrong way of doing things. We omit that for brevity. And proceed to next listing which shows correct way of doing things. Listing 1.11 Declaring the Minstrel as an aspect using XML file. Updated knights.xml:\nDeclaring Minstrel (~ M.) as an aspect:\nDeclare M. as bean . Refer to that bean in aop:aspect. Declare (using aop:before) before embarkOnQuest() singBeforeQuest() is called. ~ before advice. Declare (using aop:before) after embarkOnQuest() singAfterQuest() is called. ~ after advice. pointcut-ref attribute refers to a pointcut named embark. Important:\nMinstrel is still a POJO. Minstrel can be applied to BraveKnight, however latter remains unaware of Minstrel existence. 1.1.4 Eliminating boilerplate code with templates Listing 1.12 shows verbose example of JDBC connection, where “the small bit of code that’s specific to querying for an employee is buried in a heap of JDBC ceremony”. Listing 1.13 Templates let your code focus on the task at hand.\npublic Employee getEmployeeById(long id) { return jdbcTemplate.queryForObject( \u0026ldquo;select id, firstname, lastname, salary \u0026quot; + // Query \u0026ldquo;from employee where id=?\u0026rdquo;, new RowMapper() { public Employee mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException { Employee employee = new Employee(); employee.setId(rs.getLong(\u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo;)); employee.setFirstName(rs.getString(\u0026ldquo;firstname\u0026rdquo;)); employee.setLastName(rs.getString(\u0026ldquo;lastname\u0026rdquo;)); employee.setSalary(rs.getBigDecimal(\u0026ldquo;salary\u0026rdquo;)); return employee; } }, id); // Query parameter. }\nThis version of getEmployeeById() is acutely focused on getting employee from DB. By now author has shown:\nPOJO-oriented development DI Aspects Templates Bean configuration and aspects in XML based configuration. Ahead Spring container – where you app beans reside. 1.2 Containing your beans In spring app objects live in container (~ c.). Container:\nCreates objects (~ o.) Wires o. Configures o. Manages o. life cycle (from «new» to «finalize»). Spring’s container uses DI to manage the components that make up an application. Spring has two distinct container implementations:\nBean factories (org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory) ~ low level. Application contexts (org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext) 1.2.1 Working with an application context (~ctxt.) Application context flavors: • AnnotationConfigApplicationContext • AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext • ClassPathXmlApplicationContext • FileSystemXmlApplicationContext • XmlWebApplicationContext\nA) Loading ctxt. using FileSystemXmlApplicationContext:\nApplicationContext context = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext(\u0026ldquo;c:/knight.xml\u0026rdquo;);\nB) Similarly ClassPathXmlApplicationContext:\nApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\u0026ldquo;knight.xml\u0026rdquo;);\nThe difference between these two is that B) look for knight.xml anywhere (including JAR files).\nC) Using AnnotationConfigApplicationContext:\nApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext( com.springinaction.knights.config.KnightConfig.class);\nNote: above KnightConfig.class is configuration class.\n1.2.2 A bean’s life\nFigure 1.5 shows steps bean factory performs:\nSpring instantiates the bean. Spring injects values and bean references into the bean’s properties. If the bean implements BeanNameAware,Spring passes the bean’s ID to the setBeanName() method.

David gives a set of life lessons throughout his book for a reader to consider and follow.\nMemorable quotes and moments.\r#\rChevy Citation with \u0026ldquo;Nigger\u0026rdquo; and a Dream:\nBy the end of that year I turned sixteen and my grandfather bought me a used, doo-doo brown Chevy Citation. One of the first mornings I ever drove it to school, someone spray painted the word “nigger” on my driver’s side door. \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; fell into the well of black nationalism \u0026hellip; I wasn’t Nation of Islam material. That shit took discipline, and I had none of that. Instead \u0026hellip; I went out of my way to piss people off by becoming the exact stereotype racist white people loathed and feared. \u0026hellip; Everything I did was to get a reaction out of the people who hated me most\u0026hellip;. But I hadn’t let go of all hope. I had one more dream left.\nI wanted to join the Air Force.\nScott Gearen, man who survived freefall from 13,000 feet (3962,4 m):\nGearen didn’t really land. He bounced like a flat basketball, three times, but because he’d been unconscious, his body was limp, and he didn’t come apart despite crashing into the ground at 100 mph. He died twice on the operating table, but the ER docs brought him back to life. When he woke in a hospital bed, they said he wouldn’t make a full recovery and would never be a pararescuman again. Eighteen months later he’d defied medical odds, made that full recovery, and was back on the job he loved.\nOn education and beginning of change:\nBy chance, she called me at Johnny’s that morning and told me about a letter from school. It said I’d missed over a quarter of the year due to unexcused absences, that I had a D average, and unless I showed significant improvement in my GPA and attendance during my senior year, I would not graduate. She wasn’t emotional about it. She was more exhausted than exasperated.\nThat night, after taking a shower, I wiped the steam away from our corroded bathroom mirror and took a good look. I didn’t like who I saw staring back. I was a low-budget thug with no purpose and no future. I felt so disgusted I wanted to punch that motherfucker in the face and shatter glass. Instead, I lectured him. It was time to get real. \u0026hellip; .I looked different, and for the first time, I’d held myself accountable.\nI’d shave my face and scalp every night, get loud, and get real. I set goals, wrote them on Post-It notes, and tagged them to what I now call the Accountability Mirror, because each day I’d hold myself accountable to the goals I’d set. At first my goals involved shaping up my appearance and accomplishing all my chores without having to be asked. Make your bed like you’re in the military every day! Pull up your pants! Shave your head every morning! Cut the grass! Wash all dishes!\nAbout his job before military career:\nIf there was anything I liked about that job it was the stealth nature of working late, moving in and out of inky shadows. I loved that mask for the same reason. It was vital, and not because of any damn insecticide. I needed it because it made it impossible for anyone to see me, especially me. Even if by chance I caught my own reflection in a glass doorway or on a stainless steel countertop, it wasn’t me I was seeing. It was some janky-ass, low-budget storm trooper. The kind of guy who would palm yesterday’s brownies on his way out the door.\nSwimming first time:\nOne morning it was time to qualify for the swimming merit badge and that meant a one-mile swim in a lake course, marked off with buoys. \u0026hellip; . I dog paddled the best I could, but kept swallowing water so I flipped onto my back and ended up swimming the entire mile with a fucked-up backstroke I’d improvised on the fly. Merit badge secured.\nLife changing moment:\nI’m not going to drop the name of the restaurant where it went down because if I did you’d never eat there again and I’d have to hire a lawyer. \u0026hellip; place was a disaster. got down on my knees under the sink, and sprayed up through a narrow gap in the wall. I didn’t know it yet, but I’d found their nesting column and when the poison hit they started to scatter. Within seconds there was a skittering across the back of my neck. I brushed it off, and craned my neck to see a storm of roaches raining down to the kitchen floor from an open panel in the ceiling. \u0026hellip; They kept coming. Roaches landed on my shoulders and my head. \u0026hellip;\nI left my canister in the kitchen, grabbed the sticky traps, and burst outside. I needed fresh air and more time to figure out how I was going to clear the restaurant of vermin. I considered my options on my way to the dumpster to trash the rodents, opened the lid, and found a live raccoon, hissing mad. He bared his yellow teeth and lunged at me. I slammed the dumpster shut.\nWhat the fuck? I mean, seriously, what the fucking fuck? When was enough truly going to be enough? Was I willing to let my sorry present become a fucked-up future? How much longer would I wait, how many more years would I burn, wondering if there was some greater purpose out there waiting for me? I knew right then that if I didn’t make a stand and start walking the path of most resistance, I would end up in this mental hell forever.\nOne pull up shy:\nThat day, however, the pain was too much and after my eleventh pull-up, I gave in, dropped down, and finished my workout, one pull-up shy.\nThat one rep stayed with me, along with that one pound. I tried to get them out of my head but they wouldn’t leave me the fuck alone. They taunted me on the drive home, and at my kitchen table while I ate a sliver of grilled chicken and a bland, baked potato. I knew I wouldn’t sleep that night unless I did something about it, so I grabbed my keys.\nI did my entire pull-up workout over again. One missed pull-up cost me an extra 250, and there would be similar episodes. Whenever I cut a run or swim short because I was hungry or tired, I’d always go back and beat myself down even harder. That was the only way I could manage the demons in my mind.\nASVAB, Mechanical Comprehension test:\nI peeked over my monitor and saw him sitting there, waiting. I pointed, clicked, and left the room. Buzzing with nervous energy, I paced the parking lot for a few minutes before finally ducking into my Honda Accord, but I didn’t start the engine. I couldn’t leave.\nI sat in the front seat for fifteen minutes with a thousand-yard stare. It would be at least two days before Schaljo would call with my results, but the answer to the riddle that was my future was already solved.\n“You gotta tell me what I got on this fucking test, man,” I said. \u0026hellip; “Sir, you have no idea what this test means to me, to my life. It’s everything!”\n“There you are. Congratulations, you scored 65. That’s a great score.” He was referencing my overall, but I didn’t care about that. Everything hinged on my getting a 50- spot where it counted most. “What did I get on mechanical comprehension?” He shrugged, clicked and scrolled, and there it was. My new favorite number glowed on his screen: 50.\n“YES!” I shouted. “YES! YES!”.\nThere was still a handful of others taking the test, but this was the happiest moment in my life and I couldn’t stifle it. \u0026hellip; .On my drive home I called my mom. She was the one person, aside from Schaljo, who witnessed my metamorphosis. “I fucking did it,” I told her, tears in my eyes. “I fucking did it! I’m going to be a SEAL.”\nHell Week consists of 5 1/2 days of cold, wet, brutally difficult operational training on fewer than four hours of sleep:\n\u0026hellip; Hell Week was a mind game. The instructors used our suffering to pick and peel away our layers, not to find the fittest athletes. To find the strongest minds. That’s something the quitters didn’t understand until it was too late. Everything in life is a mind game! Whenever we get swept under by life’s dramas, large and small, we are forgetting that no matter how bad the pain gets, no matter how harrowing the torture, all bad things end.\nFinishing hell week:\nNine months earlier, I had topped out at 297 pounds and couldn’t even run a quarter mile. Back then, when I was dreaming of a different life, I remember thinking that just getting through Hell Week would be the biggest honor of my life so far. Even if I never graduated from BUD/S, surviving Hell Week alone would have meant something. But I didn’t just survive. I was about to finish Hell Week at the top of my class, and for the first time, I knew I was a bad motherfucker.\nDreams, goals and mindset:\nWhenever you decide to follow a dream or set a goal, you are just as likely to come up with all the reasons why the likelihood of success is low. Blame it on the fucked-up evolutionary wiring of the human mind. But you don’t have to let your doubt into the cockpit! You can tolerate doubt as a backseat driver, but if you put doubt in the pilot’s seat, defeat is guaranteed. Remembering that you’ve been through difficulties before and have always survived to fight again shifts the conversation in your head. It will allow you to control and manage doubt, and keep you focused on taking each and every step necessary to achieve the task at hand.\nDelirium:\nI liked Akos and had mad respect for him. I stopped and watched him move in conjoining circles, covering the same terrain over and over again. Was he looking for something? Was he hallucinating? “Akos,” I asked, “you okay, man? Do you need some help?” “David, no! I…no, I’m fine,” he said. His eyes were full-moon flying saucers. He was in delirium, but I was barely hanging on myself and wasn’t sure what I could do for him other than tell staff at the next aid station he was wandering in a daze.\nBottom line:\nThe bottom line is that life is one big mind game. The only person you are playing against is yourself. Stick with this process and soon what you thought was impossible will be something you do every fucking day of your life.\nModern culture and work ethic:\nOur culture has become hooked on the quick-fix, the life hack, efficiency. Everyone is on the hunt for that simple action algorithm that nets maximum profit with the least amount of effort. There’s no denying this attitude may get you some of the trappings of success, if you’re lucky, but it will not lead to a calloused mind or self-mastery. If you want to master the mind and remove your governor, you’ll have to become addicted to hard work. Because passion and obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back them up.\nFailure:\nAfter my 2,500th pull-up, I could barely lift my hands high enough to grip the bar, let alone clear it with my chin, and just like that, it was over. \u0026hellip; There would be no celebration at all. I failed\u0026hellip; . So did I hang my head in shame and misery? Fuck no! To me a failure is just a stepping stone to future success.\nEnlightenment through torture and pain:\nIn this life there are countless trails to self-realization, though most demand intense discipline, so very few take them. In southern Africa, the San people dance for thirty hours straight as a way to commune with the divine. In Tibet, pilgrims rise, kneel, then stretch out face down on the ground before rising again, in a ritual of prostration for weeks and months, as they cover thousands of miles before arriving at a sacred temple and folding into deep meditation. In Japan there’s a sect of Zen monks that run 1,000 marathons in 1,000 days in a quest to find enlightenment through pain and suffering. I don’t know if you could call what I felt on that bed “enlightenment,” but I do know that pain unlocks a secret doorway in the mind. One that leads to both peak performance and beautiful silence.\nSelf-doubting mind:\nAt first, when you push beyond your perceived capability your mind won’t shut the fuck up about it. It wants you to stop so it sends you into a spin cycle of panic and doubt, which only amplifies your self-torture. But when you persist past that to the point that pain fully saturates the mind, you become single- pointed. The external world zeroes out.\nConclusion.\r#\rBook presents a powerful case of human capabilities. This is not a self-improvement book, but rather a case, with historical significance.\n"},{"id":35,"href":"/docs/main-section/books/math/architecture_of_mathematics_by_simon_serovajsky/","title":"Can’t Hurt Me Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds, David Goggins review.","section":"Math","content":"\r\\[\rf(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\hat f(\\xi)\\,e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\\,d\\xi\r\\]\rstateDiagram-v2\rState1: The state with a note\rnote right of State1\rImportant information!

Feeling of awe and inspiration – You may feel inspired or guided after making your dua. Feeling of peace and calmness – After fear or worry, you might experience a profound sense of peace and calm, as if you’ve been showered with tranquility.

Also we will not get into technical intricacies.\nSony.\r#\rSony RX100 series Marketed as premium compact, these series are packed with features. Different years models might have slightly different specs (e.g. focal lengths and so on).\nRicoh.\r#\rRicoh GR series User-friendly, legendary machines.

Early models might miss a simulation or two, but generally any X100 model starting from second is a solid choice. If you are alright to lower the bar, then this might be your choice. XE’s are quite like X100’s, except they have interchangeable lenses. And if you ask me I think XTN00 series are best for a number of reasons. First, design is top notch. Old fashioned. Second, they all have pretty much same sensors (across same generation of course) and all of them have film simulations. Third, all of them (except X-pro maybe) have relatively compact size (in fact XTn00 series are smaller than X100s). Fourth, some of models listed are for peanuts in a mint condition. Fifth, most importantly – they produce almost the same images (at least the same gen sensors). I didn’t include X-Pro because it is a very specific product targeting a very specific audience. If you were part of that audience, you wouldn’t have read this article in the first place.\nOlympus.\r#\rOlympus e-m10 series. I am favored towards Oly, because I have one.

Furthermore, when they are placed in an environment where they can escape their shocks, they choose not to. This was also proven to be true for human beings.\n“In early January of 1965, we exposed the first dog to shocks from which it could escape and the second dog to identical shocks from which it could not escape. The third dog was left alone. The next day, we took the dogs to the shuttle box and gave all three shocks they could easily escape by hopping over the low barrier dividing one side of the box from the other. Within seconds the dog that had been taught to control shocks discovered that he could jump over the barrier and escape. The dog that earlier had received no shocks discovered the same thing, also in a matter of seconds. But the dog that had found that nothing it did mattered made no effort to escape, even though it could easily see over the low barrier to the shockless zone of the shuttlebox. Pathetically, it soon gave up and lay down, though it was regularly shocked by the box. It never found out that the shock could be escaped merely by jumping to the other side.”\n“Learned helplessness is the giving-up reaction, the quitting response that follows from the belief that whatever you do doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.”\nHelplessness can be unlearned.\r#\r“We worked on prevention and discovered a phenomenon we called \u0026ldquo;immunization\u0026rdquo;: Learning beforehand that responding matters actually prevents learned helplessness. We even found that dogs taught this mastery as puppies were immunized to learned helplessness all their lives. The simplifications of that, for human beings, were thrilling.”\n“It would take the next ten years of my life to prove to the scientific community that what afflicted those dogs was helplessness, and that helplessness could be learned, and therefore unlearned.”\n“Learned helplessness could be cured by showing the subject his own actions would now work. It could also be cured by teaching the subject to think differently about what caused him to fail. It could be prevented if, before the experience with helplessness occurred, the subject learned that his actions made a difference. The earlier in life such mastery was learned, the more effective the immunization against helplessness.”\nExplanatory Style (~e.s.)\r#\rQuote:\n“Explanatory style is the manner in which you habitually explain to yourself why events happen. It is the great modulator of learned helplessness.”\n“We have found over the years that positive statements you make to yourself have little if any effect. What is crucial is what you think when you fail, using the power of \u0026ldquo;non-negative thinking.\u0026quot;”\nThe way you explain things to yourself makes you immune/prone to helplessness. Speed of recovery from bad events depends on your e.s. There’s a three dimensions in which e.s. manifests itself:\nPermanence. Are bad events temporary or permanent? Good ones? Pervasiveness. Optimists believe that problems are specific. Pessimists on the other hand believe that problems pierce through every aspect of their lives. Personal. People who blame themselves often have low self-esteem. People who don’t usually preserve their self-worth by attributing failures to external causes. Explanatory style is shaped by:\nMother’s e.s., because children constantly ask why and the primary caregiver is mother. Thus she forms children’s e.s. Adult’s criticism of child. Childhood losses, traumas, and crises (divorce, death of pet). Depression\r#\rDepression has been proved to be related to habitual patterns of thought that have their genesis in the explanatory styles that lead to learned helplessness.\nDepression and pessimism connection.\r#\r“Tim Beck … quietly drew the same conclusion about depression that Wolpe had drawn about phobia. Depression is nothing more than its symptoms. It is caused by conscious negative thoughts. There is no deep underlying disorder to be rooted out: not unresolved childhood conflicts, not our unconscious anger, and not even our brain chemistry. Emotion comes directly from what we think: Think \u0026ldquo;I am in danger\u0026rdquo; and you feel anxiety. Think \u0026ldquo;I am being trespassed against\u0026rdquo; and you feel anger. Think \u0026ldquo;Loss\u0026rdquo; and you feel sadness.”\n“Depression results from lifelong habits of conscious thought. If we change these habits of thought, we will cure depression. Let\u0026rsquo;s make a direct assault on conscious thought, we said, using everything we know to change the way our patients think about bad events. Out of this came the new approach, which Beck called cognitive therapy. It tries to change the way the depressed patient thinks about failure, defeat, loss, and helplessness. The National Institute of Mental Health has spent millions of dollars testing whether the therapy works on depression. It does.”\n“How YOU THINK about your problems, including depression itself, will either relieve depression or aggravate it. A failure or a defeat can teach you that you are now helpless, but learned helplessness will produce only momentary symptoms of depression-unless you have a pessimistic explanatory style. If you do, then failure and defeat can throw you into a full-blown depression. On the other hand, if your explanatory style is optimistic, your depression will be halted.”\nRumination (~r.)\r#\rRumination is the habit of chewing or thinking in cycles (looping) about something.\n“Women are twice as likely to suffer depression as men are because, on average, they think about problems in ways that amplify depression. Men tend to act rather than reflect, but women tend to contemplate their depression, mulling it over and over, trying to analyze it and determine its source. Psychologists call this process of obsessive analysis rumination, a word whose first meaning is \u0026ldquo;chewing the cud.\u0026rdquo; Ruminant animals, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, chew a cud composed of regurgitated, partially digested food-not a very appealing image of what people who ruminate do with their thoughts, but an exceedingly apt one. Rumination combined with pessimistic explanatory style is the recipe for severe depression. This ends the bad news. The good news is that both pessimistic explanatory style and rumination can be changed, and changed permanently. Cognitive therapy can create optimistic explanatory style and curtail rumination.”\nShockingly:\r#\r“People who do not ruminate tend to avoid depression even if they are pessimists. For them, the sequence runs itself off infrequently. Optimists who ruminate also avoid depression. Changing either rumination or pessimism helps relieve depression. Changing both helps the most.”\nFight habitual thinking that leads to depression\r#\rYou learn to recognize the automatic thoughts that pop into your head at the times you feel worst and dispute your automatic thoughts by marshaling contrary evidence. You learn how to distract yourself from depressing thoughts. Thus, through cognitive therapy (paying attention to and changing how one thinks), individuals can change a pessimistic explanatory style to an optimistic one and move out of their depression.\nOn failure\r#\r“The difference between people whose learned helplessness disappears swiftly and people who suffer their symptoms for two weeks or more is usually simple: Members of the latter group have a pessimistic explanatory style, and a pessimistic explanatory style changes learned helplessness from brief and local to long-lasting and general. Learned helplessness becomes full-blown depression when the person who fails is a pessimist. In optimists, a failure produces only brief demoralization. The key to this process is hope or hopelessness. Pessimistic explanatory style, you will recall, consists of certain kinds of explanations for bad events: personal (\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s my fault\u0026rdquo;), permanent (\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s always going to be like this\u0026rdquo;), and pervasive (\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s going to undermine every aspect of my life\u0026rdquo;). If you explain a failure permanently and pervasively, you project your present failure into the future and into all new situations. For example, if rejected by someone you love, you may tell yourself, \u0026ldquo;Women [men] hate me\u0026rdquo; (a pervasive explanation) and \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m never going to find anybody\u0026rdquo; (a permanent explanation). Both of these factors, permanence and pervasiveness, create your expectation that you will be rejected again and again-that it is not just this lover who will reject you but all lovers. Explaining romantic setbacks to yourself this way will undercut all your future quests for love. If, in addition, you believe the cause is personal (\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m unlovable\u0026rdquo;), your self-esteem will suffer as well. Put all this together and you can see there is one particularly self-defeating way to think: making personal, permanent, and pervasive explanations for bad events. People who have this most pessimistic of all styles are likely, once they fail, to have the symptoms of learned helplessness for a long time and across many endeavors, and to lose self-esteem. Such protracted learned helplessness amounts to depression. This is the central prediction from my theory: People who have a pessimistic explanatory style and suffer bad events will probably become depressed, whereas people who have an optimistic explanatory style and suffer bad events will tend to resist depression”\nPessimists are easily depressed and suffer consequences a lot longer. Recovery takes months if not years, whereas optimists bounce back, so to speak, almost immediately.\nOptimism VS Pessimism\r#\rWhy go optimist?\nOptimism:\nInoculates against depression Good health (less illness, faster recovery) Positive people are attractive Successful Pessimism:\nPromotes depression Results inertia rather than action Depressed people are unattractive Poor health Achieving less in life, despite your talents. Other areas of life\r#\rOptimism has proven to deliver better results in:\nBusiness (Met Life Study) School (The Princeton-Penn Longitudinal Study) Performance (UPenn Frosh Study) Study (West Point Study) Team sports (Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations NBA teams study) Individual sports (Berkeley swim team) Politics, religion, and culture. Times when optimism should be avoided\r#\r“The fundamental guideline for not deploying optimism is to ask what the cost of failure is in the particular situation. If the cost of failure is high, optimism is the wrong strategy. The pilot in the cockpit deciding whether to de-ice the plane one more time, the partygoer deciding whether to drive home after drinking, the frustrated spouse deciding whether to start an affair that, should it come to light, would break up the marriage should not use optimism.”\nOptimists tend to overestimate, pessimists tend to have a realistic picture.\nSystem of beliefs and perception of reality\r#\r“IT IS ESSENTIAL to realize your beliefs are just that-beliefs. They may or may not be facts.”\n“We can more or less easily distance ourselves from the unfounded accusations of others. But we are much worse at distancing ourselves from the accusations that we launch-daily-at ourselves. After all, if we think them about ourselves, they must be true. Wrong! What we say to ourselves when we face a setback can be just as baseless as the ravings of a jealous rival. Our reflexive explanations are usually distortions. They are mere bad habits of thought produced by unpleasant experiences in the past-by childhood conflicts, by strict parents, by an overly critical Little League coach, by a big sister\u0026rsquo;s jealousy. But because they seem to issue from ourselves, we treat them as gospel.”\nArguing yourself against yourself!\r#\rAs shown above, we can advocate ourselves from unfounded accusations. But sometimes we bury ourselves under a criticism which grows on fertile soil made up of our beliefs (which are just beliefs). Most likely they (beliefs) have little to nothing in common with reality.\nFrom pessimism to optimism.\r#\rABCDE technique allows you to override your thinking patterns and fight your habitual thinking:\nA = Adverse event or situation\nB = Beliefs about that event\nC = Consequences of those beliefs\nD = Disputation and Distraction\nE = Energization.\nABCDE example.\r#\rAdversity:\r#\rThe adversity in this case is a breakup with a romantic partner after a long-term relationship.\nBelief:\r#\rI\u0026rsquo;ll never find someone who loves me like they did. I\u0026rsquo;m not good enough for anyone. I\u0026rsquo;ll always be alone. It\u0026rsquo;s all my fault that the relationship ended. I\u0026rsquo;ll never be happy in a relationship again. Consequences:\r#\rThese beliefs may lead to feelings of sadness, worthlessness, loneliness, and hopelessness. The person might withdraw from social interactions, avoid dating or forming new relationships, and experience a decrease in self-esteem.\nDisputations.\r#\rI\u0026rsquo;ll never find someone who loves me like they did.\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s true that the relationship ended, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you won\u0026rsquo;t find love again. Remember past experiences of love and know that there are many people in the world with the potential to love you in different, perhaps even better, ways.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not good enough for anyone.\nThis is a harsh self-judgment. Remind yourself of your positive qualities and past successes in relationships and other areas of life. Recognize that everyone has flaws, and it\u0026rsquo;s possible to find someone who appreciates and loves you for who you are.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll always be alone.\nThis is a catastrophic thought. Challenge it by considering times when you\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed your own company or formed meaningful connections with friends and family. Focus on building a fulfilling life for yourself, regardless of relationship status.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s all my fault that the relationship ended.\nRelationships involve the contributions of both individuals. Reflect on the dynamics of the relationship and consider factors beyond your control, such as compatibility issues or external circumstances. Take responsibility for your part in the relationship\u0026rsquo;s challenges, but also recognize that it takes two to tango.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll never be happy in a relationship again.\nThis is a bleak outlook on the future. Challenge it by acknowledging that while this relationship ended, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t dictate the outcome of future relationships. Focus on personal growth, healing, and being open to new experiences and connections.\nEnergization:\r#\rI am worthy of love and capable of forming healthy relationships. I am resilient and can learn and grow from this experience. I have the power to create a fulfilling life for myself, with or without a romantic partner. I accept that relationships have ups and downs, and I\u0026rsquo;m committed to learning and growing from each experience. I am optimistic about the possibility of finding happiness and love in future relationships. Conclusion:\r#\rAnd as this book has shown, helplessness becomes hopelessness and escalates into full-blown depression when a person explains his failures with permanent, pervasive, and personal causes.\nReferences.\r#\rLearned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life\nPositive Psychology: Learned Optimism By Rick Olson, PeakEffectiveness.com\n"},{"id":49,"href":"/docs/main-section/articles/contemplations/one_odd_log_op/","title":"One odd logical operator.","section":"Contemplations","content":"\rOne odd logical operator.\r#\rConditional operator p → q is believed to be equivalent of English “if p then q”.

Automated tests should be managed or reviewed by QA to avoid bottlenecks. Including tests in the codebase complicates deployments and delays releases when tests break. Under tight deadlines, releasing before testing may be necessary; this is hindered if broken tests are integrated. Combining core and test codebases introduces unnecessary libraries into production, complicating builds. Separate test code avoids compilation conflicts, allowing QA to improve coverage without delays. Mixing test code with development code causes unnecessary branch/merge issues. Separation ensures a cleaner, more maintainable codebase focused solely on production needs. Isolating test code reduces the risk of test-related bugs affecting production. Decoupled tests can be updated and scaled independently of the application, enhancing flexibility. QA teams can work on test improvements without interfering with the development cycle, boosting overall productivity. Clear separation aids in compliance and audit processes by distinctly outlining testing and production environments.

The Koreans (her relatives) with exaggeratedly enthusiastic eyes try to understand what\u0026rsquo;s in front of them. In Asian cinema, there\u0026rsquo;s always an element of reading between the lines, but here, it\u0026rsquo;s not even necessary. The entire drama surrounding Korean-French relations is written on the main character\u0026rsquo;s face. Or more precisely, on the main character\u0026rsquo;s face.\nThe boss, sweetly dragging on a cigarette, attempts to make up for 20 years of absence and abruptly involves her in the situation, detailing how he had to end his relationship with her mother and send her to France. Similar drama is observed when someone comes into a legacy IT project and tries to catch up on 20 years of absence and bring someone up to speed. Throughout the movie, the Koreans try to localize the heroine. The highly contextual style of Asian relationships doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite resonate with Freddie (yes, that\u0026rsquo;s what the French lady is called).\nCynicism and viewing sex as an accessible sport are not entirely prevalent in Korea. Instead, men in Korea get drunk and write to their women in \u0026ldquo;waves of sorrow\u0026rdquo;. Drunk people from her historical homeland try to explain something important to her in Korean. Something important. Something profound. Unfortunately, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t connect. It must be acknowledged that she speaks French quite well. French speech resembles the sound of wine gurgling into a glass. However, after a while, even that becomes tiresome. Throughout the film, the father speaks as if he\u0026rsquo;s dying from a gunshot wound, trying to whisper the password to a bitcoin wallet to his daughter, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand anything. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand not because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand Korean well, but because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand what they\u0026rsquo;re trying to convey. Or rather, why they\u0026rsquo;re trying. Because everything is already quite clear.\nThey brought her into this world, and then decided the idea wasn\u0026rsquo;t that great, so the project is being shut down.

Book depicts numerous charges and prison sentences rapper had to face, his encounters of famous industry people (Zaytoven, Scott Storch, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross, 2Chainz\u0026hellip;), his discovery of Migos, Future and others. Childhood memories, story of his family, violent neighbourhoods, drug-wars, gangs, musical inspirations etc. Everything that shaped him.\nBook consists of three parts.\nQuick summary.\r#\rRapper takes us to his roots in Alabama, introduces to his family, childhood, East Atlanta streets, trap house and the studio. He reflects on his inimitable career and in the process recollects his dark past - murder and drug charges, prison time, addiction, highs and lows in musical path.\nMemorable quotes.\r#\rOn removing gangs from Atlanta for \u0026lsquo;96 Olympic Games:\n\u0026hellip;Taking one big gang out just made room for the smaller ones to step up. When they did, they clashed. The violence continued. The drugs continued. Same shit, different toilet. .\nLife progressed. So did Gucci. Starting from selling marijuana in elementary school later on he moved to selling cocaine.\nIt wasn’t like with the weed, \u0026hellip; . This was a totally different kind of product with a totally different type of clientele.\nOn drugs:\nI’d interacted with countless fiends and they were so f***ed-up and broke it turned me off to the idea of getting high. My buddies had been pressing me to smoke weed for years but I’d resisted. As a hustler I felt above using. It seemed lame to me. Plus I wasn’t about to let my friends peer-pressure me.\nSchool beef:\nBP was fired up that morning. There was only one reason this n***a was headed back to his alma mater and that was to whoop some ass.\nOn becoming a rapper:\nAs much as I was into rap, the idea of becoming a rapper always seemed lame to me.\nDoing jail time:\nI get how for someone on the outside looking in, jail is an interesting place. Fortunately, for most people it’s a world they’ll never see. But the truth is that most of the time jail is just super boring. A whole lot of doing nothing.\nI highly regard the early era of CMR (which brought to life B.G.\u0026rsquo;s He Used 2 Be A Man, Bling Bling, Juvenile\u0026rsquo;s Back that thing up etc) and No-Limit in general (Mystikal especially). And Gucci here refers to these artirts:\nI knew Project Pat did the shit he was rapping about. Can’t nobody tell me different. I knew C-Murder did what he said. I knew Soulja Slim did what he said. I knew BG did what he said.\nOn trap:\nWhen I think about trap I think about something raw. Something that hasn’t been diluted. Something with no polish on it. Music that sounds as grimy as the world that it came out of.\nFamily ties and business:\nDamn. I’d gotten my cousin arrested and his buddy’s house burned down. And my family heard all about it. Even my brother was turned off by the trouble I was bringing around. He told my cousins they shouldn’t mess with me anymore. It hurt to see my family turn their backs on me but not enough to change anything. I was relentless.\nDrugs altering business conduct:\nThe lean had messed me up, but it wasn’t until a few days later that I fully felt the effects of the drug. Out of nowhere, it seemed, I was totally out of my mind. It was like I couldn’t control my thoughts. I found myself doing irrational shit I would never do normally, like giving people stupid deals on dope. I was thrown off, but I didn’t yet make the connection to the lean. Maybe I’ve been smoking too much. Maybe someone put something in my drink at the Waffle House and tried to poison me. I was still tripping when I got back to Atlanta a few days later and my symptoms had gotten worse than selling people dope on the cheap. My behavior was f***ed up.\nBecoming pregnant because of lean:\nBy that point I was drinking it first thing in the morning and last thing at night to fall asleep. My stomach had ballooned to the size of a watermelon. I looked pregnant. Even then I wasn’t ready to hear that. I couldn’t accept that this drug had become my kryptonite.\nOn meeting his fan:\nBefore we left, Shawty Redd told me he wanted to introduce me to someone he’d been working with who was a fan of mine. His name was Young Jeezy. He had him on the phone.\nOn meeting Juvenile:\nI wasn’t interested in paying that much money for a Juvenile beat. I didn’t even know the **g*a made beats.\nFulton county prison:\nI haven’t exactly tested out every jail in the country, but I can tell you there ain’t too many places like Fulton County. That place has got to be one of the most fucked-up correctional facilities in the United States.\nFulton County Jail was not like DeKalb County, where I’d just spent a week before making bond on my murder charge and done my sixty-seven days back in 2002. DeKalb was heavily policed, with a bunch of old, white, racist good ol’ boy COs running the show. They love fucking with n**gas in there.\nSolitary confinement:\nBut the hole started f**king with me. With no human contact the only person I could talk to was myself, and I was saying crazy things, over and over again until I believed them. My thoughts became consumed by how many people had gotten convicted for murders they hadn’t committed. More and more I started thinking that my life could be over. Over what? Nothing. Some song.\nPot belly:\nA known side effect of codeine is constipation and all the drank sitting in my stomach had given me a gut. I didn’t give a *c. My little potbelly wasn’t stopping these beautiful women from wanting to ***k me. The lean would have me so nonchalant and relaxed, it would only make them want me more.\nGrowing anxious and feeding pigeons:\nI returned to reality, if only momentarily, when a staff member informed us we would require extra security before we could enter. Moments later ten LAPD officers showed up and proceeded to debate whether I was allowed in the venue. I’d seen other celebrities arrive and walk in without a problem. Why was this happening to me? Why the fuck would these people invite me here and then do this to me? I grew increasingly agitated. It was too little, too late by the time we were allowed to enter the Nokia Theatre. The flash of cameras from the media only angered me more. It felt like they were taunting me. I pulled out the ten-thousand-dollar stack in my pocket and threw it in their faces. I kept replaying the incident in my head during my flight back to Atlanta the next day. Me standing there on the white carpet of the VMAs, watching reporters fight over hundred-dollar bills like I was feeding pigeons. That was so stupid. Why the fuck would I do that?\nOn losing his mind:\nA plea of mental incompetency was warranted. I’d lost my damn mind.\nGucci on chick demanding to take her to her job at Buckhead.\nThe arguing continued until I put that bitch out of my car, but let me be clear on this. I don’t think I put this girl in no danger. But she went out and got herself a lawyer and demanded fifteen thousand dollars, claiming that my car was in motion and she was tumbling down the street or something.\nOn Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson:\nI swear the rats were the size of cats in that place. I never thought I’d be so happy to be back at Fulton County when I was transferred back three weeks later.\nTough guys and the rap game:\nIn the rap game there are so many people who feel like they need to keep the tough-guy shit going 24/7 and can’t even hold a conversation.\nUnited States Penitentiary in Terre Haute:\nThe United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute was not like the federal facilities I’d just come from in Lovejoy, Leavenworth, or Oklahoma City. \u0026hellip;I was surrounded by lifers and men on death row. The Aryan Brotherhood, MS-13, Crips, Bloods, mob bosses, terrorists\u0026hellip;. But I’m a man wherever you land me. Regardless of where that is or who is in front of me, there’s a standard that I hold myself to and a certain level of respect I expect to be treated with. That ain’t even on some tough-guy shit. Hell, I was scared too. When people talk about prison you often hear them talk about wolves and sheep. To survive you’ve got to be a wolf. But here it was all wolves. Tough guys were getting killed here every day. You could be Gucci. You could be Al Capone. It didn’t matter because they’d kill your ass the same. This was a place full of men with nothing to lose. There were nights I lay in bed and I could hear the sound of someone sharpening shanks. I prayed those knives weren’t meant for me.\nOn faith:\nI remembered that as low as my lows had gotten, I always had faith in myself. That I always knew if I could get past those temporary moments, eventually I’d be up again. Jail couldn’t beat me. Lean couldn’t beat me. No situation could beat me. I was the only one who could beat me.\nPhysical fitness:\nWith the way my stomach had gotten, for years I hadn’t been able to fit into a lot of the clothes I wanted to wear. I started with a run up and down a flight of steps. It was all I could do and I was out of breath. Then I ran up and down twice. Then three times. The next day I did five. A week later I did twenty. Very quickly the routine became like another addiction to me and between that and barely eating the snack food they serve in county jail, the pounds started falling right off. I wasn’t the only one who noticed.\n35 years prison sentence:\nThis was bad. Very bad. I had two weapons charges. One from when I got arrested by the Kroger on Moreland and one from the incident the day before at my lawyer’s office. Each of those charges carried up to ten years in prison. Then I still had my open assault case in Fulton County to deal with. Between the feds and the state of Georgia I was facing thirtyfive years. Fuck.\nSelf improvement:\nI followed the changes I’d made to my body by working to strengthen my mind. I was devouring books. A lot of self-help, inspirational stuff. Tony Robbins. Deepak Chopra. Malcolm Gladwell. James Allen. The biographies of Pimp C. and Jimi Hendrix. Mike Tyson’s autobiography.\nConclusion.\r#\rGucci did what he intended - masterfully presented his upbringing and jounrey to become a rap legend. Unlike most rappers who promote derogatory lifestyle author shows that but there is more to it than that. Gucci was able to overcome his drug addictions, and rebuilt himself. Truly inspiring story.\n"},{"id":59,"href":"/docs/main-section/photography/the_end_of_digital_photography/","title":"The end of Digital Photography.","section":"Photography","content":"\rThe end of Digital Photography\r#\rGlobal camera market is in decline.\r#\rForeword\r#\rAs if world didnt\u0026rsquo; suck enough, digital photo is becoming part of the past.

Rapes, murders, bank robberies, cat lovers.\nMemorable quotes and moments.\r#\rInmates and marriage:\nFor reasons that no one at Leavenworth quite understood, inmates rarely had trouble finding women willing to correspond or visit them. Surprisingly often, these relationships led to marriage.\nSilverstein:\n\u0026ldquo;Can’t,\u0026rdquo; he replied. “I don’t have any hot water to use to clean it.” The guards said later that they were genuinely shocked. For six months, Silverstein had been taking cold showers because no one had turned on the hot water valve into his cell. The guards claimed that this was an accident.\nLittle and Bowles:\nAs Little told Bowles good-bye, the young inmate couldn’t help but notice that the convicted killer, one of the most dangerous inmates in the entire federal system, had tears in his eyes.\nWilliam Post:\nHis only regret about leaving was the cats. “I was outside in the exercise area yesterday and I saw Tiger, and they say cats forget you and don’t miss you, but I saw Tiger and he runs over, so I reached out and petted him and he purred like he was saying, ‘Hey, where you been?’ ” Shortly after he was arrested, Post had sent word to Carl Bowles and asked him to feed the cats. Bowles, who worked in the west yard near the trash dumpster where Post kept his cat supplies, had agreed. “I know Carl will take care of Tiger for me,” Post said. “He’ll be okay. I’m weaning myself from Tiger too now. I have to.”\nA short time later, he was ordered to pack his personal belongings. We talked for a final time in the Hole about his life.\n“If I could keep only one memory or moment in my life and that was it—all the rest would be erased—I think the one moment that I would keep is the shootout with the police in Glendale. The experience of shooting it out with that cop was absolutely, totally, the most beautiful experience in my life. I’m not crazy. It was beautiful!\nThe Order and BLA:\nThree of the inmates taken to the Hole with Post were members of the Black Liberation Army, a sworn enemy of all whites. But necessity had made the two groups join forces, Thomas said. “They had a common bond. All of the inmates were doing heavy, heavy time, and they all wanted out.”\nNorman Bucklew, bank robber:\nBucklew was taken to a cell in the St. Clair County Jail in Belleville, Missouri, but when the jailer started to open the cell door, Bucklew stopped him.\n“Hey, you put me in a cell with these four niggers, and you’re gonna find cold bodies tomorrow,” Bucklew said. “I don’t cell with niggers.”\nThe jailer didn’t know what to do, and neither did the black inmates inside the cell. “I’m telling you, someone’s gonna be killed if I go in there, and it ain’t gonna be me,” Bucklew repeated.\nHe was taken to a different cell.\n“Most whites fuck up right away when they come into prison, because they try to be friendly,” Bucklew said later. “Let’s say a white dude is put in a cell with maybe fifteen niggers. If he says hello or even nods to them, then he’s already doomed. You see, half of them will think he is just being polite and treating them with respect, but the other half will know he is weak and afraid, because they know that a white man isn’t even going to acknowledge them if he’s been in prison before, because whites don’t speak to niggers in prison. These niggers are going to move on that guy as soon as the hack disappears.”\nThe St. Louis police were able to link Bucklew to five bank robberies. He received the maximum sentence of 125 years.\nOn Robert L. Matthews, first black ever put in charge of the Hot House:\nAt the local watering hole for guards, a tiny bar called Benny’s located a few blocks from the Hot House, it was not uncommon to hear racial slurs between sips of beer and during dart games. A white guard would later recall a conversation that took place before Matthews reported to work. “There is nothing wrong with niggers,” one guard said. “In fact, I think everyone should own a few of them!” When the laughing ended, he added, “But work for a nigger warden? Holy shit, what’s the bureau coming to?”\nConclusion.\r#\rChapter 50 must read.\n"},{"id":61,"href":"/docs/main-section/motion-pictures/movies/east/the_tale_of_zatoichi/","title":"The Tale of Zatoichi","section":"East","content":"\rThe Tale of Zatoichi\r#\rReview.\r#\rGood one.\nScreenshots.\r#\r"},{"id":62,"href":"/docs/main-section/motion-pictures/movies/east/tremble_all_you_want/","title":"Tremble All You Want","section":"East","content":"\rTremble All You Want (2017)\r#\rPlot and review.\r#\rFirst love - to an extent we have all expereinced this at varying degrees of success. Like a powerfull drug, many of us (incl. me) are guilty of chasing this imaginary dragon throughout our adulthood.\nFilm portraits Yoshika Eto, 24 y.o. accountant, as she obsesses over her middle school love Ichi, whom she fantacized as Natural Born Prince. An obsession she constantly informs the cast of characters giving screenplay anime\u0026rsquo;ish (cartoonish) vibes millenials will surely admit. At the very same time she is thwarting advances of her colleague Ni (\u0026rsquo;two\u0026rsquo; in japanese, making him and Ichi \u0026rsquo;two\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;one\u0026rsquo; respectively). Call for (classmate) reunion nourishes her dream even further. Here, we witness that she lives in a realm of fantasy.\nMayu Matsuoka (actress) manages to project social awkwardness with brilliance, although she is built as one (or two, if we count her fascination with extinct animals) dimensional character.\nIn the movie\u0026rsquo;s second act, upon learning how invisible she is to Ichi, and thereby leaving this pursuit altogether, her well-being becomes solely reliant on (creepy and forced) attention she receives from her (ex) colleague Ni (real name Kirishima).\nVerdict.\r#\rSadly, neither Yoshika\u0026rsquo;s class act, nor her deteriorating mental state, are not enough to save this film from \u0026ldquo;becoming a pointless execise in generic rehashing\u0026rdquo;.\nMemorable moments.\r#\rReferences.\r#\rBlood Brothers [Jamie Cansdale]\nCinema Slasher [Blair Hoyle]\neasternKicks.com [Pieter-Jan Van Haecke]\neasternKicks.com [Prince Lee]\nEFilmCritic [Jay Seaver]\nEyeForFilm.co.uk [Jennie Kermode]\nFilm Carnage [Rebecca Cherry]\nFilmDoo [David Pountain]\nJumpCut Online [Elena Morgan]\nkalafudra.com [Lena Lisa Vogelmann]\nNo es cine todo lo que reluce [Daniel Farriol] (Spanish)\nQuinlan.it [Giampiero Raganelli] (Italian)\nSonatine: Appunti sul cinema giapponese [Valerio Costanzia] (Italian) The Japan Times [Mark Schilling]\nVCinema [Alessandra Bautze]\nWebs of Significance [YTSL]\nWindows on Worlds [Hayley Scanlon]\n"},{"id":63,"href":"/docs/main-section/books/culture/russian_spirit_in_the_country_of_samurai._life_in_japan_in_first_person/","title":"Русский дух в стране самураев. Жизнь в Японии от первого лица","section":"Culture","content":"\rРусский дух в стране самураев. Жизнь в Японии от первого лица\r#\rDisclaimer\r#\rВведение.\r#\rУвлекательная книга известного блогера о его жизни в Японии.\nИнтересные моменты из книги.\r#\rО соседях - китайцы студенты и MMORPG:\nЕго сложно было назвать мачо, даже хоть сколько-нибудь отдаленно, да и хвастаться в принципе было нечем, поэтому я не мог понять сам смысл его поведения. В комнате Ри мазался каким-то кремом и влезал обратно в свои любимые черные лосины. За время проживания в этом общежитии я не заметил, чтобы он как-то заметно похудел, поэтому, скорее всего, чудодейственная сила лосин для похудения переоценена.\nКо всему прочему Ри был отаку – этот термин означает людей, которые очень сильно чем-то увлечены. Он был просто без ума от аниме, манги и онлайновой многопользовательской компьютерной игры World of Warcraft. Он учился в первой половине дня, а все остальное время проводил за игрой или просмотром аниме. Самое печальное было то, что другие соседи по квартире тоже играли в World of Warcraft, и практически все время с утра до ночи китайцы перекрикивались через закрытые двери, сообщая друг другу о чем-то, что я не мог понять. В некоторые моменты у них был такой восторг и они издавали такие протяжные вопли, что я подскакивал от испуга.\nВоровство еды:\nМои сожители оказались бедными китайцами, у которых нет денег на еду, но им нужно хорошо питаться, чтобы успешно учиться в языковой школе, поэтому им ничего не оставалось, как воровать еду у меня. Оказалось, что все это они делали для достижения высоких результатов в учебе.\nПервая подработка:\nКак бы там ни было, Ли Сяо предлагал подработку по созданию ажиотажа в новом кафе. Знаете, бывает такая система, когда при открытии нового магазина или ресторана нанимают специальных людей, чтобы они стояли в очереди, тем самым заинтересовывая прохожих. Люди начнут думать, что раз столько клиентов, то значит, действительно, хорошее место и его стоит посетить. Платили за такую подработку 800 йен в час, что в принципе немного, но лучше, чем вообще ничего. \u0026hellip; . Открывалось новое кафе на станции Эбису, и мне нужно было прийти к нему в назначенное время и просто встать в очередь.\nУ кафе уже стояло порядочно людей, но моих друзей китайцев нигде не было видно. Я встал в конец очереди и начал выполнять то, за что мне платили. За пять с небольшим часов я так ни разу и не встретился с моими сожителями, что показалось мне странным. Отработав, я получил от Ли Сяо, который сам ко мне подошел, обещанные деньги, и пошел домой. Поднимаясь на третий этаж своего общежития, я услышал какие-то крики и вопли, словно в квартире дрались одновременно пять Лю Кенгов из игры Mortal Kombat. Открыв дверь, я увидел, как в коридоре стоят мои сожители и о чем-то громко спорят. Оказалось, что они приехали на станцию Эбису, но даже не посмотрев на карту и не уточнив название кафе, встали в совершенно другую очередь, ведущую к булочной, в которой в тот день проходила акция. Китайцы почти пять часов ходили туда-сюда, пока к ним наконец-то не подошел один из работников булочный и не спросил, зачем они уже какой раз заходят и выходят. Странно, что их не смутили взгляды персонала, булочная вместо кафе и вообще вся это ситуация, но в итоге они ничего не заработали и очень сильно переживали по этому поводу. Ну, а мой первый опыт подработки в Японии закончился вполне себе удачно.\nСдача экзамена:\nЯ положил открытку на стол перед собой и глубоко вдохнул, чтобы немного унять дрожь в руках. Я так не переживал даже во время защиты диплома в университете. Мне необходимо было набрать минимум 90 баллов и не менее 19 баллов в каждой из трех категорий экзамена. Я потянул за краешек открытки и затаил дыхание. Внизу была надпись 合格 (Passed), что переводится, как «сдано». Мой результат был 146 из 180 баллов. Я не мог поверить своим глазам и еще раз все внимательно перечитал. Ошибки не было, указано мое имя, результат и информация о том, что я сдал. Сказать, что я был счастлив, – ничего не сказать. Вот так вам!\nРусский парень показал вам, где раки зимуют, если в Японии вообще понимают такое выражение.\rОсмотрев аудиторию, я заметил, что более половины одноклассников сидят печальные, а некоторые даже плачут. Я уже позже узнал, что часть студентов в моем новом классе пытались сдавать на второй уровень, но практически все провалились. Интересно, что же ждет меня?..\nВторая подработка:\nУже на второй рабочий день мне добавили обязанностей. Сказали, чтобы я не только мыл посуду, но еще и готовил гёдза – блюдо китайской кухни, прижившееся в Японии и представляющее собой тесто с начинкой из мяса (чаще всего свинина) и овощей (обычно капуста). Говоря простыми словами, гёдза – это привычные нам жареные пельмени, но в китайско-японском стиле. И вот эти самые гёдза мне сказали приготовить, хотя на тот момент я их даже ни разу не пробовал. Начальник раменной показал мне способ приготовления и сказал, чтобы теперь я этим занимался, если вдруг кто закажет, а заказывали много.\nПервые гёдза, которые я попытался приготовить, просто-напросто сгорели, и их стоимость вычли из моей зарплаты.\nЗаключение.\r#\rЗахватывающее чтиво. Как у всех подобных книг, один минус - книга слишком короткая.\n"}]
