<p>Chevy Citation with &ldquo;Nigg**&rdquo; and a Dream:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>By the end of that year I turned sixteen and my grandfather bought me a
used, doo-doo brown Chevy Citation. One of the first mornings I ever drove
it to school, someone spray painted the word “ni##er” on my driver’s side
door. &hellip; I &hellip; fell into the well of black nationalism &hellip; I wasn’t Nation of Islam
material. That shit took discipline, and I had none of that. Instead &hellip; I went out of my way to piss people off by
becoming the exact stereotype racist white people loathed and feared. &hellip; Everything I did was to get a reaction out of the people who hated me most&hellip;.
But I hadn’t let go of all hope. I had one
more dream left.<br>
I wanted to join the Air Force.</p></blockquote><p>Scott Gearen, man who survived freefall from 13,000 feet (3962,4 m):</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>Gearen didn’t really land. He bounced like a flat basketball, three times, but
because he’d been unconscious, his body was limp, and he didn’t come apart
despite crashing into the ground at 100 mph. He died twice on the operating
table, but the ER docs brought him back to life. When he woke in a hospital
bed, they said he wouldn’t make a full recovery and would never be a
pararescuman again. Eighteen months later he’d defied medical odds, made
that full recovery, and was back on the job he loved.</p></blockquote><p>On education and beginning of change:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>By chance, she called me at Johnny’s that morning and told me about a letter from school. It
said I’d missed over a quarter of the year due to unexcused absences, that I
had a D average, and unless I showed significant improvement in my GPA
and attendance during my senior year, I would not graduate. She wasn’t
emotional about it. She was more exhausted than exasperated.</p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>That night, after taking a shower, I wiped the steam away from our corroded
bathroom mirror and took a good look. I didn’t like who I saw staring back. I
was a low-budget thug with no purpose and no future. I felt so disgusted I
wanted to punch that motherfucker in the face and shatter glass. Instead, I
lectured him. It was time to get real. &hellip; .I looked different, and for the first time, I’d held myself accountable.</p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>I’d shave my face and scalp every night, get loud, and
get real. I set goals, wrote them on Post-It notes, and tagged them to what I
now call the Accountability Mirror, because each day I’d hold myself
accountable to the goals I’d set. At first my goals involved shaping up my
appearance and accomplishing all my chores without having to be asked.
Make your bed like you’re in the military every day!
Pull up your pants!
Shave your head every morning!
Cut the grass!
Wash all dishes!</p></blockquote><p>About his job before military career:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>If there was anything I liked about that job it was the stealth nature of working
late, moving in and out of inky shadows. I loved that mask for the same reason.
It was vital, and not because of any damn insecticide. I needed it because it made
it impossible for anyone to see me, especially me. Even if by chance I caught my
own reflection in a glass doorway or on a stainless steel countertop, it wasn’t me
I was seeing. It was some janky-ass, low-budget storm trooper. The kind of guy
who would palm yesterday’s brownies on his way out the door.</p></blockquote><p>Swimming first time:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>One morning it was time to qualify for the swimming merit badge and that meant a one-mile
swim in a lake course, marked off with buoys. &hellip; . I dog paddled the best I could, but
kept swallowing water so I flipped onto my back and ended up swimming the
entire mile with a fucked-up backstroke I’d improvised on the fly. Merit badge
secured.</p></blockquote><p>Life changing moment:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>I’m not going to drop the name of the restaurant where it went down because if I
did you’d never eat there again and I’d have to hire a lawyer. &hellip; place was a disaster. got down on my knees under the sink, and sprayed up through a narrow gap in
the wall. I didn’t know it yet, but I’d found their nesting column and when the
poison hit they started to scatter.
Within seconds there was a skittering across the back of my neck. I brushed it
off, and craned my neck to see a storm of roaches raining down to the kitchen
floor from an open panel in the ceiling. &hellip; They kept coming. Roaches landed on my shoulders and my head. &hellip;</p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>I left my canister in the kitchen, grabbed the sticky traps, and burst outside. I
needed fresh air and more time to figure out how I was going to clear the
restaurant of vermin. I considered my options on my way to the dumpster to
trash the rodents, opened the lid, and found a live raccoon, hissing mad. He
bared his yellow teeth and lunged at me. I slammed the dumpster shut.</p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>What the fuck? I mean, seriously, what the fucking fuck? When was enough
truly going to be enough? Was I willing to let my sorry present become a
fucked-up future? How much longer would I wait, how many more years would
I burn, wondering if there was some greater purpose out there waiting for me? I
knew right then that if I didn’t make a stand and start walking the path of most
resistance, I would end up in this mental hell forever.</p></blockquote><p>One pull up shy:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>That day, however, the pain was too much and after my eleventh pull-up, I gave
in, dropped down, and finished my workout, one pull-up shy.</p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>That one rep stayed with me, along with that one pound. I tried to get them out
of my head but they wouldn’t leave me the fuck alone. They taunted me on the
drive home, and at my kitchen table while I ate a sliver of grilled chicken and a
bland, baked potato. I knew I wouldn’t sleep that night unless I did something
about it, so I grabbed my keys.</p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>I did my entire pull-up workout over again. One missed pull-up cost me an extra
250, and there would be similar episodes. Whenever I cut a run or swim short
because I was hungry or tired, I’d always go back and beat myself down even
harder. That was the only way I could manage the demons in my mind.</p></blockquote><p>ASVAB, Mechanical Comprehension test:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>I peeked over my monitor and saw him sitting there, waiting.
I pointed, clicked, and left the room. Buzzing with nervous energy, I paced the
parking lot for a few minutes before finally ducking into my Honda Accord, but
I didn’t start the engine. I couldn’t leave.</p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>I sat in the front seat for fifteen minutes with a thousand-yard stare. It would be
at least two days before Schaljo would call with my results, but the answer to the
riddle that was my future was already solved.</p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>“You gotta tell me what I got on this fucking test, man,” I said. &hellip; “Sir, you have no idea what this test means to me, to my life. It’s everything!”</p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>“There you are. Congratulations, you scored 65. That’s a great score.” He was referencing
my overall, but I didn’t care about that. Everything hinged on my getting a 50-
spot where it counted most.
“What did I get on mechanical comprehension?” He shrugged, clicked and
scrolled, and there it was. My new favorite number glowed on his screen: 50.</p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p><strong>“YES!” I shouted. “YES! YES!”.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>There was still a handful of others taking the test, but this was the happiest
moment in my life and I couldn’t stifle it. &hellip; .On my drive home I called my mom. She was the one person, aside from
Schaljo, who witnessed my metamorphosis. “I fucking did it,” I told her, tears in
my eyes. “I fucking did it! I’m going to be a SEAL.”</p></blockquote><p>Hell Week consists of 5 1/2 days of cold, wet, brutally difficult operational training on fewer than four hours of sleep:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>&hellip; Hell Week was a mind game. The instructors used our suffering to pick and peel
away our layers, not to find the fittest athletes. To find the strongest minds.
That’s something the quitters didn’t understand until it was too late.
<strong>Everything in life is a mind game!</strong> Whenever we get swept under by life’s
dramas, large and small, we are forgetting that no matter how bad the pain gets,
no matter how harrowing the torture, all bad things end.</p></blockquote><p>Finishing hell week:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>Nine months earlier, I had topped out at 297 pounds and couldn’t even run a
quarter mile. Back then, when I was dreaming of a different life, I remember
thinking that just getting through Hell Week would be the biggest honor of my
life so far. Even if I never graduated from BUD/S, surviving Hell Week alone
would have meant something. But I didn’t just survive. I was about to finish Hell
Week at the top of my class, and for the first time, I knew I was a bad
motherfucker.</p></blockquote><p>Dreams, goals and mindset:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>Whenever you decide to follow a dream or set a goal,
you are just as likely to come up with all the reasons why the likelihood of
success is low. Blame it on the fucked-up evolutionary wiring of the human
mind. But you don’t have to let your doubt into the cockpit! You can tolerate
doubt as a backseat driver, but if you put doubt in the pilot’s seat, defeat is
guaranteed. <strong>Remembering that you’ve been through difficulties before and have always survived to fight again shifts the conversation in your head.</strong>
It will allow you to control and manage doubt, and keep you focused on taking each and
every step necessary to achieve the task at hand.</p></blockquote><p>Delirium:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>I liked Akos and had mad respect for him. I stopped and
watched him move in conjoining circles, covering the same terrain over and over
again. Was he looking for something? Was he hallucinating?
“Akos,” I asked, “you okay, man? Do you need some help?”
“David, no! I…no, I’m fine,” he said. His eyes were full-moon flying saucers.
He was in delirium, but I was barely hanging on myself and wasn’t sure what I
could do for him other than tell staff at the next aid station he was wandering in  a daze.</p></blockquote><p>Bottom line:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>The bottom line is that life is one big mind game. The only person you are
playing against is yourself. Stick with this process and soon what you thought
was impossible will be something you do every fucking day of your life.</p></blockquote><p>Modern culture and work ethic:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>Our culture has become hooked on the quick-fix, the life hack, efficiency.
Everyone is on the hunt for that simple action algorithm that nets maximum
profit with the least amount of effort. There’s no denying this attitude may get
you some of the trappings of success, if you’re lucky, but it will not lead to a
calloused mind or self-mastery. If you want to master the mind and remove your
governor, you’ll have to become addicted to hard work. Because passion and
obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back
them up.</p></blockquote><p>Failure:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>After my 2,500th pull-up, I could barely lift my hands high enough to grip the
bar, let alone clear it with my chin, and just like that, it was over. &hellip; There would be no
celebration at all. I failed&hellip; . So did I hang my head in shame and misery? Fuck no! <strong>To me a failure is just a stepping stone to future success.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Enlightenment through torture and pain:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>In this life there are countless trails to self-realization, though most demand
intense discipline, so very few take them. In southern Africa, the San people
dance for thirty hours straight as a way to commune with the divine. In Tibet,
pilgrims rise, kneel, then stretch out face down on the ground before rising
again, in a ritual of prostration for weeks and months, as they cover thousands of
miles before arriving at a sacred temple and folding into deep meditation. In
Japan there’s a sect of Zen monks that run 1,000 marathons in 1,000 days in a
quest to find enlightenment through pain and suffering. I don’t know if you
could call what I felt on that bed “enlightenment,” but I do know that pain
unlocks a secret doorway in the mind. One that leads to both peak performance
and beautiful silence.</p></blockquote><p>Self-doubting mind:</p>
<blockquote class='book-hint '>
<p>At first, when you push beyond your perceived capability your mind won’t shut
the fuck up about it. It wants you to stop so it sends you into a spin cycle of
panic and doubt, which only amplifies your self-torture. But when you persist
past that to the point that pain fully saturates the mind, you become single-
pointed. The external world zeroes out.</p></blockquote><p><img src="/david-goggins-big-think-video-still.jpg" alt="Goggins with an ak emerging from water" /></p>
