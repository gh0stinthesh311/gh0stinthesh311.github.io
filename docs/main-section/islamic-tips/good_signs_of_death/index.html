<meta name="description" content="🌟 The 7 Good Signs in One Body — Summary &amp; Reflection#
Here is a concise summary of the 7 good signs seen in the body of the deceased man from the story.

🌿 7 Good Signs in One Body (Summarized)#


No Impurity Released After Death#

Normally, bodily waste exits after death during ghusl (ritual washing).
This man’s body remained clean, even after being pressed multiple times.



Finger Raised in Shahada#

His index finger remained raised in testimony (tashahhud) position.
Attempts to straighten it failed, and it would return to that position.



Face Glowing#

Despite dim lighting, his face visibly glowed with no external explanation.
The glow remained even after wiping the face with cotton.



Fragrance from the Body#

A strong, sweet scent emanated from his body, overpowering any perfume.
It lasted through ghusl, shrouding, prayer, and burial.



Grave Was Freezing Cold#

Despite 45°C summer heat, the grave was ice-cold when the body was placed.
The sheikh experienced shivers inside the grave — something unheard of.



Raised Finger While Heart Had Stopped#

A nurse saw the deceased raise his index finger in shahada after clinical death.
The monitor had gone flat, yet his body moved one final time.



He Was the “Light of the Masjid”#

Attended the mosque consistently for 15&#43; years, always in the first row.
Came before Fajr, stayed after Isha, often reciting Qur’an.
The imam and janitor confirmed his unwavering devotion.




🏁 Bonus: His Final Intention#
He intended to fast the day he passed away — woke for suhoor, drank water, and passed away with fasting as his last conscious goal.
This further supports a righteous death (ḥusn al-khātimah).">
